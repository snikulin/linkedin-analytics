# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified in the project and the actions taken to address them.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed
1. Updated all dependencies to their latest versions where possible
2. Fixed vulnerabilities in jspdf, vite, and vite-plugin-pwa through dependency updates

## Remaining Vulnerabilities
### xlsx Package (High Severity)
- **Issue**: Prototype Pollution (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6) and Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9)
- **Status**: No fix available in the current version
- **Affected Version**: 0.18.5 (latest available)
- **Risk Mitigation**: 
  - Input validation is implemented in our parsing code
  - Files are processed client-side only, reducing attack surface
  - Users are expected to only upload their own LinkedIn export files
  - Application runs in browser sandbox environment

## Recommendations
1. Monitor the xlsx package for future security updates
2. Consider implementing additional input sanitization for uploaded files
3. Evaluate alternative libraries if a secure version becomes available
4. Regularly run npm audit to identify new vulnerabilities

## Additional Security Measures
- All data processing is done client-side with no server communication
- No data is stored on external servers
- LocalStorage is used only for storing dataset references, not actual data
- Application runs in a browser sandbox environment
